# Email-spam-detection-using-machine-learning
An email spam classifier using Navie Bayes Algorithm and TFIDF vectorizer

'''Install all the packages mentioned in program first to run the program without error'''
   Synax to install  """"pip3 install <package_name>"""

----------------------STEPS------------------------------
After installation of required packages
1> Run the file "spam_detection_model.ipynb"
2> After the running program, if there is no error both the model for 
   Navie Bayes and TFIDF Vectorizer will be obtained
3> Now run "app.py" using Streamlit framework
